# Cloud and Clear - Infrastructure Templates

Welcome to the official repository for [Cloud and Clear](https://cloudandclear.com) blog's infrastructure-as-code templates, patterns, and examples. This repository serves as a practical companion to the blog posts, allowing you to quickly deploy and test the solutions discussed.

## 🌟 About Cloud and Clear

The journey of Cloud and Clear began in 2003, when the cloud was still just something in the sky. Over two decades of IT experience has culminated in this resource focused on making cloud technologies accessible to all.

The name "Cloud and Clear" reflects our approach to cloud technology education. The cloud landscape can be overwhelming, filled with jargon, complex architectures, and an ever-expanding set of services. Our mission is to cut through that complexity and present cloud concepts in a clear, accessible way.
